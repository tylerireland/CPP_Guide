# Working with MIXR (Mixed Reality Simulation Platform)

In this write up :
- I will explain how to open up Mixr with Visual Studio
- I will show how to add and run some examples
- I will record my process in creating a simple graphical simulation  

By the end I hope to a have solid understanding of mixr and how each component works together.

### Goal
I am working with the mainSim1 example, which is a simple simulation of an aircraft flying at a set speed. I plan to track it's position and output it to a graphical display. Eventually, I may try to find ways to interact with the aircrafts velocity and heading and also output that to a display.


## Opening MIXR in Visual Studio
1. First, download the current release [**_here_**](https://www.mixr.dev/downloads.html)
    - you will need to download the **Framework, Examples, Example Data,** and **32-Bit 3rd Party Libraries**
2. Extract all files into one folder.
3. Open ` mixr / build / vs2017 / mixr.sln ` in visual studios.
 
## Running an Example
Once mixr is opened in visual studio:
1. Select File > Add > Existing Project
2. In the file explorer, select ` mixr_examples / build / vs2017 / mainSim1.vcxproj `
3. This should add the project into the solution.
4. Before running the project, open up the mixr_examples folder once again, but this time select the folder with the same name as your project
5. Double Click ` make-edl.cmd `. This will create any required .edl files to run the program
6. Back in Visual Studo, right click on your project and select ` Set as Startup Project ` and the run the solution
7. The project should build and run successfully


## mainSim1 example
1. The .epp file is located in ` mixr_examples / mainSim1 / configs `
- At first glance, this file is really small. There are not many line at all. The description says that it is a single aircraft player (player being the aircraft).
- A station is initialized and within the station contains an image generator, an interoperability interface, and a simulation scenario. 
    - Both interfaces are commented out, so I believe that they are not too important for the prgram to run.
- Looking at the simualtion scenario, there is a lat/postion, as well as a player that continase the aircraft name, id, type, signature, XPos, Ypos, altitude,
  heading, velocity, and side.
- The player is an blue-sided F-16A Aircraft, with an altitude of 20000 feet, and a velocity of 250 (mph?)
- In this simulation, there is an aircraft flying at 250 (mph?). I am going to find a way to track his position and update it to the console. Once completed, I will try to output the positon to a GLUT display.
